# Demo-DomainSpecificChatbot
This is an implementation of a domain-specific chatbot powered by GPT models. The chatbot is created with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique.

The chatbot implementation includes functionalities such as diverse data handling, embedding generation, storage of embeddings in FAISS (a vector store), creating dynamic prompts, integrating with MongoDB to store user conversations, provision of an accessible API endpoint for integration with mobile and web apps, and integrating with the OpenAI Chat Completion API. Additionally, it has few files containing mock hospital data and a requirements file listing all necessary libraries for running this project.
